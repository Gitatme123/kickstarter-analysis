# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**
#### "Louise's play *Fever* came close to her goal in only a short amount of time." She is curious to know more about the date of the launch or the goal set on the campaign and if they have any relationship to the outcome of the campaigns.


#### The purpose of this project is to use the data we've already combed through to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates and their funding goals. We will do this so that we can provide Louise with conclusions to her 2 questions. When she attempts her next kickstarter theater project she will know more about when to launch the campaign and how much to launch it for in order to optimize her potential for success.


## **Analysis and Challenges**


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#####*From this data I can see that the best month to launch a kickstarter could be in May. Now this could also be due to many other factors since the number of failed.
#####*I can also tell that the number of failed kickstarters is relatively consistent throughout the year with none being canceled in October even though there was an increase in successes and failures launched during that month. 
#####*It is difficult to get a full picture without having the total kickstarters launched line to compare the peaks and valleys against.
#####*It also appears that the best tie to launch a theater kickstarter is between the summer months, between April and August.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#####*The average success rate is 66% for these plays. 
#####*The chart shows me that as the goal increases the opportunity to succeed decreases except for a range between 35,000-45,000 the success rate climbs back past its average. Avoid launching with a goal between 20,000 and 35,000 but you really have better than 50% chance at succeeding if you stay out of that range. It does appear that there is a sweet spot for a goal about between 35,000 and 45,000 with the best =.
#####*The distribution is symmetric. Every change from each goal increment to the next created an equal yet opposite change in other variable. For example a goal between 1000 to 4999 had a 27% failure rate and a 73% success rate. Transitioning to the 5000 to 9999 range we see a 45% failure rate and a 55% success rate. An increased failure rate of 18% and a decreased success rate of 18%.
#####*It appears that the potential for success drops significantly after it surpasses a specific goal threshold. The success rate then showed a glimmer of hope above 50,000 but I would need to see that distribution to accurately analyze if having a goal above $50k leads to greater success.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
#####*I had a difficult time connecting Git to my laptop. I followed instructions online and feel like I lucked into it working. I am not sure I could replicate the process if asked again. I will need to reinforce this at some point in the future. 
#####*I also had trouble making my chart look exactly like the chart displayed in the instructions. I could not get the chart to look as rectangular as the one in the example. Even so, the instructions did say to make it look "Like" the one shown. I was able to do that.
#####*Another difficulty was with the instructions. For example, we are supposed to create a chart that compares the outcomes based on goals for a segment of our dataset. We are supposed to use the countif function by filtering for the outcome, goal and plays. We were then told to name the chart "Outcomes Base on Goal". This only adds confusion down the line, is this plays? Is this Theater? Things should be named appropriately and the instructions only make it more difficult to navigate through all of our files.
#####*There was no clarity or expectation of using the work done in Module 1 for the Challenge #1. What were we supposed to do with the data from the module we went through? What about the folder we originally saved the document in?



## **Results**

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
#####1. I can conclude that the most Theater kickstarters are launched between April and August with the peak coming in May.
#####2. I can also conclude that the amount of kickstarters that were canceled and the amount that succeeds in some capacity related. The slope for the 2 are in the same direction for 9 out of the 12 months. The total number of theater kickstarters is not correlated with the number that are canceled, as that is pretty consistent throughout and does not follow the same slope.

## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
#####1. I can conclude that launching a kickstarter with a goal ranging from 45,000 to 49,000 is a bad idea. Since there are only 2 variables here, with the canceled being 0, we know that the graph will look symmetric since they have to equal 100%.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
#####*The size of the data set. We are using just over 4000 different campaigns. I would like to analyze a few of these data sets to find the standard deviation of the outputs of each and if its within range I believe we can be confident in the distribution of this data set. This dataset also provides everything as an average for each month

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
#####*We should always have the total number of campaigns per month on the charts we are creating. I believe the volume should always be taken into account when looking at a data set. The distribution of data points throughout each of the months of the year would be great to see along with the other 2 charts.
#####*I also believe that the global climate is always evolving and trends play an important role in our world. That being said looking at a year by year comparison would help to recognize if there is a particular outcome that the data is trending towards.
